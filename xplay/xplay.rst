Automatically Add Memory to a VM When A Constraint is Detected
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

How often have you been on-call, and got that alert or service ticket for a VM that was having High memory or CPU?
Chances are a lot, and generally during dinner, while you are out with family, or sleeping.

What if you could use XPlay in Prism Pro to automatically take care of this for you when Prism Pro detected the constraint?
Good news, you can. Let's walk through how to set that up.

Reduce Memory On A VM During A Maintenance Windows
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Xfit in Prism Pro utilizes Machine Learning to continually analyze the environment. This is helpful to detect resource constraints, such as our memory constraint in the last lab, as well as inefficiencies.

Inefficiencies could be Virtual Machines with over provisioned vCPU or Memory.

In this exercise we will create a playbook to take care of memory over provision.

Create Playbook
...............

In **Prism Central** > select :fa:`bars` **> Operations > Playbooks**.

Click **Create Playbook**.

Select :fa:`bell` **Alert** as Trigger, and click **Select**.
